RetroArch Phoenix Liscence:
	
This is sort of a rebirth of the deprecated RetroArch Pheoenix, Gui located at 
https://github.com/Themaister/RetroArch-Phoenix, created by me and not
affiliated with the developers of RetroArch; I do like the name though.

This frontend is completely based off of the OpenEmu design. Please support them also.
Their site is located here http://openemu.org/

Do whatever you want to with this frontend. You do not have to, but it would be nice if 
you would let me know of any advancements or of any derivative works that you create.
I will be setting up a github account shortly.
