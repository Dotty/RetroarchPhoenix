# RetroarchPhoenix


##A rebirth of a desktop U.I.

This is a "rebirth" of the RetroArch Phoenix project that was deprecated. This is to provide RetroArch with an all-in-one graphical interface that focuses on desktop use. RGUI is a great interface for your console and T.V. This project is so far just a clone of the [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) frontend. Please show support for their hard work. This project will provide a lot of the functionality that they have provided, and more. Furthermore this project is not affiliated with the official [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) developers. However I did like the Phoenix part.

This project was done using Qt 5.2.
